## Aiken-Aiken

**Books read:** 1

**Title:** _The Girl from Paris_

**Author:** Joan Aiken

**Status:** I grew up with Joan Aiken's children's books (_Wolves of Willoughby Chase_, etc, etc.) It wasn't until late high school/early college that I discovered her adult works. One of them (coming up in the next entry) became one of my favorite books ever.

I don't think I've read _The Girl from Paris_ since I acquired it, 15-20 years ago. It is a bit strange for an Aiken book, I think. As though she decided to write her version of a Daphne du Maurier novel. It reminds me most of Rachel Field's _All This and Heaven Too_.

**Result:** This was an enjoyable read, a period piece with its fair share of melodrama. But I don't know that it's something that I desperately need to keep in my collection. On to a new happy home, little book!
