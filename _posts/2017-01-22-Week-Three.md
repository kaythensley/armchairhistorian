## Aiken-Alcott

**Books read:** 4
It was a bit of a banner week this week. A combination of Metro delays and short books.

**Title:** _A Cluster of Separate Sparks_

**Author:** Joan Aiken

**Status:** When I am asked to provide a list of my favorite books of all time, this is invariably part of the list. Something about the Grecian setting (though I have never had any particular desire to visit Greece) and the heroine (Georgia Marsh is a very human main character). I get pulled in from the first sentence, every time.

This particular book also has the distinction of being the very first book I bought from Amazon....back when Amazon only sold books.

**Result:** It's one of my favorite books, and a piece of internet history...of course I'm keeping it.

**Title:** _An Old Fashioned Girl_

**Author:** Louisa May Alcott

**Status:** I didn't realize I owned so much Alcott until I started this project. Maybe it's a holdover from growing up in Massachusetts (near where Bronson Alcott started his transcendental community, in fact), but there is something very endearing about Alcott's novels.

_An Old Fashioned Girl_ is a faintly moralizing tale of a poor girl who is richer (in spirit) than her wealthy friends and how she shows them the value of hard work and love over money and fashion. It's a sweet story, and relatively self-aware.

**Result:** Although it is a Dell-Yearling Edition (probably purchased at a book fair sometime in the 80s), there's nothing particularly keepable about this book. On to a new happy home with you!

**Title:** _Eight Cousins_

**Author:** Louisa May Alcott

**Status:** I wish I could remember where I acquired this book. A library book sale? A used bookstore? The copyright date is 1917, making it the 3rd oldest book in my collection (based on edition, not original printing date, obviously).

Another tale of goodness in the face of temptation, and children learning from their elders and those less well off than them.

**Result:** _Eight Cousins_ is probably my favorite Alcott book. Coupled with the age of my print copy, this is one worth hanging on to.

**Title:** _Rose in Bloom_

**Author:** Louisa May Alcott

**Status:** This is the sequel to _Eight Cousins_, purchased on a visit to Louisa May Alcott's house in 2002, or thereabouts.

We get to see all our friends from the previous book all grown up. There's a bit of melodrama and everyone who needs pairing off gets paired off. Not as thoroughly enjoyable as _Eight Cousins_, but it does feature a woman going off to earn her own living and an interracial marriage, which is pretty cool.

**Result:** If I'm hanging on to _Eight Cousins_, I'd better keep hold of this one too.

**Additional Ephemera:**
Comments are now enabled! Also, I've added a new rule to the project. If I own multiple copies of a story, I only have to read one of them. (This will become important later)
