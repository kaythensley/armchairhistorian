## Fforde-Irwin

**Books read:** 4

**Title:** _Thursday Next: First Among Sequels_

**Author:** Jasper Fforde

**Status:** It was very strange to read this immediagely after finishing the first Thursday Next book, _The Eyre Affair_. _First Among Sequels_ is the 5th book in the series (the first in the so-called 'Second Arc' that takes place about 20 years after the  first one). So huge mental shift from First Book Thursday to Fifth Book Thursday. Honestly, I think Fforde is one of the cleverest modern writers I've read. As you move through his ouvre you can tell he's more aware of his own cleverness as well, which some might find annoying. Overall, It's a fun, weird, engaging read.

This is a hardback version that I was lucky enough to have autographed by Mr. Fforde himself when he came to the independent bookstore in my hometown.

**Result:** Obviously I'm keeping it.

**Title:** _The Princess Bride_

**Author:** William Goldman

**Status:** Like many a nerdy child of the '80s, I have the movie _The Princess Bride_ memorized. For many years it was my 'sick movie' (ie, one of the films I watched anytime I was home sick from school - the others are 1776 and Dead Poets Society). As was my wont, I found the book on my mother's shelves and powered through it to see how it compares. On previous readings, I powered through Goldman's introduction (and most of his asides). This time I read it through and the intro doesn't really paint a compelling picture of the guy, for all that it's pseudo-autobiographical. But the story is still great, and I could see it all in technicolor in my head. As an aside, the cover on this book is the most bizarre, lurid '70s artwork. 

**Result:** This is a keeper.

**Title:** _Young Bess_

**Author:** Margaret Irwin

**Status:** _Young Bess_ is the first book in the Elizabeth I trilogy, a historical fiction retelling/imagining of her early years. I am no Tudor historian, but I stole these from my mother, who has much more background in that period, so I'm guessing they're relatively accurate. (Although written in the 1940s, so not a modern take). They certainly feel well researched. I remember devouring all three books as a child but this first one felt much more slow going. Maybe I was more interested in the nuances Tudor family relationships when I was a tween. The main problem is that I didn't find anyone particularly likeable. I think that's more my problem than any fault of the writing, however.

**Result:** I believe I shall return this (and its friends) back to my mom.

**Title:** _Elizabeth, Captive Princess_

**Author:** Margaret Irwin

**Status:** The second book in the Eilizabeth I trilogy takes us from Edward's death through to Mary's marriage to Philip of Spain. It read faster than the first (most of the players have either been established or beheaded by now), but still suffered from me not having much empathy for anyone. 

Also, apparently RKO made a movie called "Young Bess" in 1953 that is based off of this book and its predecessor. I might have to track that down.

**Result:** Going home to mom.
