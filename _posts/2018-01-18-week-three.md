## Mitford-Nathan

**Books read:** 2

**Title:** _The Pursuit of Love & Love in a Cold Climate_

**Author:** Nancy Mitford

**Status:** This is two novellas in one book. Where to even begin? Both of these stories revolve around the same characters, mostly members of the landed gentry in England in the period between the wars and into WWII. _The Pursuit of Love_ is my favorite of the two, and was often quoted in my house as a child (mostly 'the thin end of the wedge' and 'foreigners are fiends'). _Pursuit_ is semi-autobiographical and both are under the heading of satirical. _Love in a Cold Climate_ is a sadder book in a way, not just in plot but in getting to see some of the behind the scenes stuff from _Pursuit_. I found myself annoyed that the narrator's husband seemed to be a bit more of a prat than we are initially shown in _Pursuit_.

**Result:** If these were separate books, I'd keep the first and pass on the second...but as they're not, keeping the whole thing.

**Title:** _The Night Before Christmas_

**Author:** Clement C. Moore, illustrated by Douglas Gorsline

**Status:** I'm a bit out of season with this one, but what can you do? This is the same Random House edition that we had growing up. My father would often read it to us on the Christmas Eve. The illustrations are richly detailed and seem appropriately old-timey. What else can I say? It's a classic.

**Result:** I have most of the poem memorized, but keeping this for sentimental reasons.

**Title:** _Pride, Prejudice and Jasmin Field_

**Author:** Melissa Nathan

**Status:** Austen retellings and I have a bit of a complicated history. ...it usually ends with me throwing the book at the wall. There are three exceptions to this rule, and this book is one of them. (For those playing along at home, the others are _Old Friends and New Fancies_ by Sybil Brinton, first published in 1913 and _Northanger Abbey_ by Val McDermid.) This is the story of columnist Jasmin Field who is cast to play Elizabeth Bennet in a charity production of _Pride & Prejudice_. As rehearsals begin the events of the play are mirrored in Jasmin's real life. The reason I don't want to throw the book at the wall is that it is a very clever modern update. As Jasmin and her Darcy start to fall for each other, they're pretty aware of the irony. The women are all given a bit of an update - Jasmin's mom is a feminist, her sisters are slightly less silly and 'Lady Catherine deBurgh' only appears briefly to compliment Jasmin (having once been a great actor).

**Result:** I have read this book a dozen times, I think it's time for it to move on to a new home.
