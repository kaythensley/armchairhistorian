## L'Engle-L'Engle + Green

**Books read:** 2

**Title:** _An Acceptable Time_

**Author:** Madeline L'Engle

**Status:** In the same universe as the Wrinkle in Time series, _An Acceptable Time_ focuses on Meg & Calvin's daughter, Polly. She's spending the year with her Meg's parents and strange time things are afoot. There are threads that continue on from _A Swiftly Tilting Planet_ and storylines from other Polly stories. And then there's Zachary Gray. It reminds me of _Many Waters_ in some ways - the setup is a bit similar.

What's really interesting about this book, more than the story, is that it was a birthday gift from my defacto godmother and within the pages I found a picture of myself in high school and my next younger brother's baby picture.

**Result:** It's a good story, though not my favorite of L'Engle's...keeping for the sentimental value.

**Title:** _The Chronicles of Meep_

**Author:** John Green

**Status:** This is a comic book version of my favorite episode of Phineas and Ferb (a rare deviation from my universal Disney hatred). It's very adorable and fun. I bought it because I was desperate for any merch around the episode.

**Result:** Given that I could watch the episode whenever I want on the internet, I think I may send this onward. Long live Big Mitch!
