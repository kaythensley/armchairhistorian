## Alcott-Alcott

**Books read:** 2

**Title:** _Little Women_

**Author:** Louisa May Alcott

**Status:** This is the Puffin Classic edition from my childhood. I fancied myself like Jo, though I suspect I am actually more like Meg or Amy. Reading it as an adult I am more aware of the moralizing and the sense of what the proper girl/woman was. (Although Alcott was a suffragette so it's a bit more progressive than some, I would guess).

**Result:** Easy enough to acquire in electronic format, so onward with you!

**Title:** _Good Wives_

**Author:** Louisa May Alcott

**Status:** Usually _Good Wives_ is included in printings of _Little Women_ as the second half of the book. But originally, and in my collection, it was a separate work. We catch up with the March family three years on and watch as they grow up, settle down and cope with tragedy.

Do we need spoilers on a book originally published in 1869? I was always on the Jo/Laurie train, and Amy butting in used to make me mad. This time through it didn't bother me as much.

**Result:** I think this one will follow its colleague to a new home.
