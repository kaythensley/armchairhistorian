## Orczy-Orczy

**Books read:** 1

**Title:** _The Scarlet Pimpernel_

**Author:** Baroness Orczy

**Status:** This has been a favorite of mine for a long time, and inspired many an essay. In later years I've had more trouble reading it because Lady Blakeney is such a pain - I'd rather hear more about Percy's adventures than how his wife keeps messing things up. There are so many references to her being 'just a poor weak woman.' I did have a bit more sympathy for her this time, she makes the best use of the agency she is given that she can. I still want more Percy though. Also, this is the first use of the secret identity trope. You're welcome super hero fans.

**Result:** My copy is quite old and battered, but I will hang on to it. The Scarlet Pimpernel is my favorite hero :)
