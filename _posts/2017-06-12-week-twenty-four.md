## Irwin-Heyer (plus bonus Burnett)

**Books read:** 3

**Title:** _Elizabeth and The Prince of Spain_

**Author:** Margaret Irwin

**Status:** The last of the Elizabeth I Trilogy, about half of this book is spent not on Elizabeth at all but giving backstory for Philip. It actually starts before the previous book ends, and details the events leading up to Philip leaving Spain for England to marry Mary. I think that may be why I found it the hardest going of all the books. I wasn't particularly interested in what Philip was up to, I wanted Elizabeth to take the throne already.

**Result:** Back home to Mom.

**Title:** _The Secret Garden_

**Author:** Frances Hodgson Burnett

**Status:** Do you remember, many weeks ago, when I reported on _A Little Princess_ and I said if I could find _The Secret Garden_ in the same binding I would totally get it? (Despite such a statement being much at odds with the entire objective of this exercise) Well...I did and I did :). Though I don't find it as unabashedly charming as _A Little Princess_, _The Secret Garden_ is very much a part of my childhood and a book I have read many times over the years. I'm glad to add to the shelf in this one instance.

**Result:** Duh.

**Title:** _Black Sheep_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** Okay, we need to take a moment to talk about Georgette Heyer. Well, more than a moment, as you will soon see. Heyer takes up the most real estate of any one author on my shelf. I currently own 15 Heyer novels (and two non-fiction books about her, which we will see later). One of her works is on every 'favorite books list' I've ever attempted. Probably more than Austen, Heyer informed my historical interests. (I started reading both at about the same time). The posts are going to be a bit same-y for a while, and I have a feeling I may not want to read another Heyer novel for a long time once I've read my entire collection straight through.

Also, a note about order. In past moves, I have ordered my Heyer collection by time period in which the novels occurred. However, this time around I seem to have put all the standard paperbacks together, then all the trade paperbacks. (15 moves in 16 years, may I remind you.) They do all seem to be alphabetical within their format, however.

First up is _Black Sheep_. Set in 1816/1817, this is one of the Heyers that makes me laugh the most. The dialogue between the main characters is often quite silly. It is one of the unusual ones that has a bit of a ramshackle (though still wealthy) hero. He isn't in the least bit fashionable or polished, but the heroine falls for him anyway. The heroine is also a bit of an 'original' herself. Good times. This is a 1969 Pan edition that I stole from my mother.

**Result:** Keep.
