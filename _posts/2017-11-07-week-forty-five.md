## McIntyre-McKinley

**Books read:** 2

**Title:** _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_

**Author:** Vonda N. McIntyre

**Status:** The novelization of the best Original Series movies (fight me). Star Trek VI is one of the handful of movies I can recite almost word for word. Time Travel, Whales, Spock swearing, what's not to love?

The book has the ability to delve deeper than the movie could into characters and internal thoughts and motivations. There's even a sprinkling of feminism as Gillian realizes how far humans have come in the twenty-third century.

I was given the book by my 7th grade best friend and it still has her phone number written in the back (as Spock - I was Kirk, but I now see myself much more as a McCoy type :)

**Result:** I now own the movie on DVD and the paperback has seen better days, so I think I will send this on and hope it falls into the hands of someone who loves this story as much as I do.

**Title:** _The Hero and The Crown_

**Author:** Robin McKinley

**Status:** McKinley is one of my favorite authors. I received both this book and _The Blue Sword_ for Christmas when I was maybe eleven or twelve. _The Blue Sword_ comes first in the series, but _The Hero and The Crown_ is the first chronologically...and apparently I decided to shelve them chronologically. So, this is the story of Aerin, who becomes an almost mythical legend by the time of _The Blue Sword_, but is actually a teenager who spends a lot of time being injured. She's a very relatable heroine, clumsy and hard-headed at times who wants to feel like she belongs somewhere.

As with all of McKinley's books, there's a point at the climax where I know I'm reading too fast to get all the details but I'm pulled along by the momentum of the story and can't slow down. It's like coming down a roller coaster, you can't see anything clearly, but you know exactly what's happening.

**Result:** I hate breaking up a set :) More to come with _The Blue Sword_'s entry.
