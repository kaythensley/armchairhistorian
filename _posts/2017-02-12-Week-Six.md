## Austen-Austen

**Books read:** 1

**Title:** _Sense & Sensibility_

**Author:** Jane Austen

**Status:** The 1996 S&S is possibly my favorite Austen film adaptation ever (it's always a close race between it and 1995's Persuasion). My copy of _Sense & Sensibility_ is the movie cover, complete with photos from the film. I've read this story a number of times (the broken spine clearly attests to that), but it's been some time since my last read. I was surprised by how stark it seemed on this reading. Elinor is much more dispassionate than I remember, and the narration is blunter. Austen was never one to pull punches, I suppose. I guess I'd forgotten how that comes across in the text. It'll be interesting to see how I feel about the other Austens coming up (one next, one when we get to oversized fiction).

**Result:** Movie stills or no, I think I can send this one on to a new home and replace with an electronic version.
