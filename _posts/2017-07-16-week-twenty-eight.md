## Heyer-Heyer

**Books read:** 6

**Title:** _April Lady/Pistols for Two_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** This one requires a bit of clarification. _April Lady_ is a novella and it is usually packaged with _Pistols for Two_, a collection of short stories. So this is actually 12 tales in one. _April Lady_ feels like an early draft for _The Convenient Marriage_ (see down the page). All the short stories are lovely -but people get paired off almost instantly in most cases, which strains credulity a bit (even in this genre).

**Result:** Shallow as it is, I really dislike the cover of this book. I think I shall send it on and see if I can get it electronically.

**Title:** _The Talisman Ring_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** This is one of the three top-tier Heyers for me. Intrigue, adventure, a mystery and delightful pairings. And of course, the origin of the concept of riding _ventre a terre_.

**Result:** Keepsies!

**Title:** _The Convenient Marriage_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** Hey, remember when I mentioned this book a couple of paragraphs ago? This is a strong second-tier novel for me. It takes some of the plot elements from _April Lady_ and expands upon them. (Horatia might be one of my favorite Heyer heroines) Good fun, strong supporting characters.

**Result:** Keep for sure.

**Title:** _Cotilion_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** This is my mom's favorite. Kitty is a pretty conventional heroine, but Freddy is unlike any other Heyer hero to my knowledge. (Imagine Bertie Wooster in a cravat). I nearly cited _Cotillion_ in one of my theses because Freddy talks about how he couldn't take the Grand Tour like his father did owing to Napoleon.

**Result:** I wouldn't mind a different edition of this one, but I shall keep.

**Title:** _Devil's Cub_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** This is a sequel to my all-time favorite Heyer, but I'm reading it now because a) that's the way the alphabet works b) you don't really need to have read it's predecessor to understand what's happening c) it's my blog and I do what I want. Although perfectly entertaining, it doesn't live up to its sire. And there's something sad about seeing the beloved characters from the first book in middle age...especially as Heyer decided that one of the secondary characters would become even more dissolute as an older man.

**Result:** I don't want to break up the family, so I will keep :)

**Title:** _The Masqueraders_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** Fun facts time! This was the first Heyer book I ever read. (I think somewhere between age 10-12...after I had discovered Austen) It remains one of my top three to this day. It seems that the ones where there is a bigger plot than just tying up the couples neatly tend to do better with me. Interestingly, (by which I mean to probably only me) two of the top three are set mid-century, which was the period I ended up focusing on in my research. (At the time I was much more of a committed Regency person...) Anyway, intrigue, cross-dressing, sword fights, secret heritages, the book has it all. It's also the one that I think would translate best to a visual medium. (HBO, call me!)

**Result:** Prue & the Mountain OTP!

Only 4 more Heyers to go, people!
