## Heyer-Heyer

**Books read:** 4

**Title:** _Charity Girl_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** This is a rare-ish bird - a Heyer I haven't read (or don't remember reading, anyway). It's a bit of an unusual one as well, as for the first third of the book I wasn't entirely sure who our Hero was going to pair up with. (There are many things I love about Heyer novels, but they are not usually subtle) Perhaps because it wasn't one of those 'how are these two going to get together' ones, I didn't find it as enjoyable as some.

**Result:** I think I will send this home and see if my mom is in need of a copy.

**Title:** _The Corinthian_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** I have 3 top-tier favorite Heyer novels, but there are a number of second-tier ones that I am always happy to revisit. _The Corinthian_ is one of those. Dry, drawling hero? Check. Young, plucky heroine (in male clothing)? Check. A series of misadventure and scrapes that all untangle in the final pages? Check. What's not to love? This is a 1974 Bantam edition that I stole from my mother.

**Result:** There will always be room on the shelf for this one.

**Title:** _The Grand Sophy_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** _The Grand Sophy_ probably exists in that second-tier, but for different reasons. This was my dad's favorite Heyer book (also, the only one my mom ever got him to read, coincidentally). My dad was many things, but he was not a great reader. (My dad brought the music, my mom brought the books.) It is a great romp, to be sure, and Sophy is the most plucky of all the Heyer heroines, but for me there are too many annoying characters to make it one of my most favorites. Although certainly one I will reread regularly.

**Result:** Keep.

**Title:** _Lady of Quality_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** I vaguely remember reading this one before. It reminds me a good deal of _Black Sheep_ and _Bath Tangle_ (I think _Bath Tangle_ is coming later on...). It has an amusing setup, gruff hero and unconventional heroine - though one of the rare actually pretty ones.

**Result:** Keep.

Survived my first week of non-stop Heyer! I think by the end of this I'll be ready to write some kind of lit crit or analysis of the canon as a whole. My brain keeps trying to slot them all into categories and find patters and draw conclusions about Heyer as a person. Maybe I missed my calling as an English major....
