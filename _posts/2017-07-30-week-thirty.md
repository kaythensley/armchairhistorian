## Heyer-Heyer

**Books read:** 4

**Title:** _The Nonesuch_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** I don't hate any Heyer novels, but this is definitely on the far end of the 'like' spectrum. The hero is a bit boring and goody-goody, the heroine is sensible and clever until the plot requires otherwise. And then there are the supporting characters. Tiffany Wield might be the most horrible secondary character in the canon. I will say, this is one of the Heyers that ends too abruptly. There are a few where it comes to a relatively neat close, but you really wish there were a couple more pages to let you know what happens next. (Most importantly, does that damn Tiffany ever get her comeuppance?)

**Result:** I've gone back and forth on this one, but the object is to keep the books I really love/need. So I shall see if my mom needs a new copy of _The Nonesuch_.

**Title:** _Powder and Patch_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** I didn't read this one for the first time until recently. It is one of the shorter novels - longer than _April Lady_, but not by much. However, there's a lot to like in the slim volume. Some dueling, a lot of frippery affectations and Frenchification :). _Powder and Patch_ isn't really about the heroine, which is a bit unusual. (Just as well, as she's kind of an idiot.)

**Result:** Keep, the affectations are too adorable.

**Title:** _The Reluctant Widow_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** If you can get past how insane the set up is, this is a great story in the style of _The Talisman Ring_. (You know I love the ones with intrigue best of all.) Secret passages, espionage, a puppy...what's not to like? The set up is really mental though.

**Result:** Keep!

**Title:** _These Old Shades_

**Author:** Georgette Heyer

**Status:** This is the end, my beautiful friend. The last of the Heyers. And what a one to end on. _These Old Shades_ is the final piece of my favorites triumvirate. (And the predecessor to _Devil's Cub_, if you're playing along at home.) So why do I love this one so much? Cross-dressing, mystery, fantastic supporting characters. The spunkiest heroine (even spunkier than Horry!) and the coolest hero around. No one can match Justin Alistair's imperiousness. <3

**Result:** Keep, of course!

I don't know what to do with myself now that I've read every Heyer I own. ...oh wait, I still have another 3.5 shelves to get through. Stay tuned!
