## McKinley-McKinley

**Books read:** 2

**Title:** _The Blue Sword_

**Author:** Robin McKinley

**Status:** Whenever I am asked about my favorite books, this one is always on the list. (And it is always a list.) The story is set when Aerin's tale has faded into myth and legend. Harry, like Aerin, is looking to belong. Destiny is rather forced upon her and she has to come to terms with that and a life completely foreign than what she expected. There's magic and adventure and horses and sword fighting, but what I think I like best is how atmospheric it is. It's such vivid world building. And it doesn't hurt that the book opens with Harry scowling at her orange juice. (When I was young I thought it was the best opening to a book ever.)

**Result:** Keep. No question.

**Title:** _Chalice_

**Author:** Robin McKinley

**Status:** My copy of this book is an ARC (advance reading copy) and was a gift from a friend, who picked it up at a convention. _Chalice_ plays fast and loose with its timeline for most of the story (much in the way _The Hero and the Crown_ did), which is a bit confusing at first. The Chalice is the second most important role in the magic circle in this world and is a role thrust upon our heroine (who goes by Chalice for most of the story but was known as Mirasol beforehand). Before she was made Chalice she kept bees and the bees and honey become part of her magic as Chalice. Again, our herione is looking for a place to belong (she was a simple beekeeper before her elevation to Chalice and doesn'tr really feel part of the circle).

At the beginning, Mirasol reminds me a bit of the early Tiffany Aching stories, where Tiffany doesn't really know how to do magic but is polite and coaxing, trying to get the earth to respond.

**Result:** I enjoyed this book, but I think it's ready to move on to a new home.
