## Kendall-L'Engle

**Books read:** 3

**Title:** _The Gammage Cup_

**Author:** Carol Kendall

**Status:** This is one of many books that just appeared on my boookshelf when I was young, courtesy of my mother. It's a cute tale about a small village where being different isn't really tolerated, but when danger comes the villagers learn the importance of bravery and working together.

**Result:** While it's very cute and readable, there's nothing particularly special about it. I will send it on its way.

**Title:** _From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler_

**Author:** E.L. Konigsburg

**Status:** Konigsburg was one of my favorite authors as a kid, and this was my favorite of her books. Like a many a future museologist, I was inspired by Claudia and Jamie's adventures running away to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Getting to live behind the scenes of a museum, what could be cooler? My edition is an Aladdin Books copy from 1987. Honestly, the book was already dated when I read it then (first published in 1967). As a kid I didn't really notice how far off the prices of things were, or the fact that I had no idea what an automat was. It didn't keep me from the story. As and adult, I read it more as a period piece. Although, I identify more with Claudia and her need to run away TO something and to have it change the ordinariness when she returns.

**Result:** Keep

**Title:** _A Wrinkle in Time_

**Author:** Madeline L'Engle

**Status:** I have read this book so many times, but each time feels brand new. I read it for the first time in 2nd grade, and all the science-y stuff went over my head. But the characters were so interesting and IT so scary that it didn't matter. As an adult, I find Meg far too impatient but I completely understand the expectation that her father will fix everything, and the frustration and disappointment when she realizes he can't and it's up to her to get through. This is my Dell-Yearling Edition from 1987. I thought I was excited for the new movie before... :)

**Result:** Keep!
