## Adams-Adams

My plan is to make a weekly BP post summarizing progress to date.

**Books read:** 1

**Title:** _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_

**Author:** Douglas Adams

**Status:** I have had this story practically memorized since the age of 8 or so. My
brother and I would listen to the audio version over and over (and over) again. The intro to the radio play used to be his ringtone, in fact.

The physical book is a relatively recent addition (within the last 5-10 years) to my collection, mostly after realizing I didn't have a paper copy in my possession.

**Result:** Hitchhiker's Guide is one of my favorite books of all time, and has had a massive
impact on my sense of humor and outlook. However, this particular physical copy has no major significance, so I will be dispensing with it and replacing with an electronic copy.
