## Alcott-Alcott

**Books read:** 1

**Title:** _Behind a Mask: The Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott_

**Author:** Louisa May Alcott

**Status:** Much like Jo in _Little Women_, Alcott dabbled in sensational fiction. This is a collection of 4 of her 'lurid' tales. I wonder how truly thrilling or sensational they were at the time. They feel more like slightly moralizing Gothic stories. There are ghosts and murders and revenge and things, but the wicked people generally come around by the end of the story and the surviving folks all pair off and live happily. Definitely more energetic than the other Alcott stories I've read recently, but still recognizable as her.

**Result:** It's an interesting set of stories, but nothing I feel compelled to own in book form.
