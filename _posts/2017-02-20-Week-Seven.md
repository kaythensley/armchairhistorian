## Austen-Barclay

**Books read:** 2

**Title:** _Northanger Abbey_

**Author:** Jane Austen

**Status:** A Penguin Popular Classics edition dating to around high school, this book looks like it has been through the wars. Lots of scuffing, a bit of water damage. I think the last time I read _Northanger Abbey_ I hadn't done much research into the Gothic novels Austen was satirizing. Having now spent much more time among the period, I appreciate the send up more. Also, Catherine and Henry might be my new favorite Austen pairing. Catherine isn't particularly bright, but she's at least aware and willing to learn. Henry is full of wit and snarkiness, which is definitely the way to my heart. Bonus points for the baseball reference and Catherine being a tomboy in her youth (with no stigma attached).

**Result:** Definitely acquiring in electronic format.

**Title:** _The Mistress of Shenstone_

**Author:** Florence L. Barclay

**Status:** This is the oldest book in my collection, dating to 1910. It was a gift from a dear friend of long standing and has managed to survive 16 moves with me. It is a romantic and moral tale with plenty of coincidences, twists, turns and dramatic reveals. And God...a fair bit of God in there too. It is very sentimental in nature but a fun read. It also contains the fabulous line "You tread on sacred ground, and you forget to remove your shoes."

**Result:** Until it crumbles to dust in my hands, I'm keeping this one on the shelf.
